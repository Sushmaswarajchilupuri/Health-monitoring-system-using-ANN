Classification is the process of predicting the class of given data points. Classes are sometimes called as targets/ labels or categories. Classification predictive modelling is the task of approximating a mapping function (f) from input variables (X) to discrete output variables (y). 

Approach :

A dataset consisting of samples of data related to the 5 parameters Age, Pulse, Blood pressure (Systolic and Diastolic), Blood glucose and alert is created. The parameters are given as input to the model for training. After the training, manual inputs are given for estimating the health condition of the patient.
